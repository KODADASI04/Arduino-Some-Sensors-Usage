# What You Will See Here?
Here you can find the codes I wrote while using some sensors I use in Arduino.
Here, using a motor with arduino, turning the motors and going straight, using a current sensor, using a bluetooth sensor,
With EEP, arduino keeps data in itself, using gyro tilt sensor, using pulse sensor,
You will be able to see the codes to use an infrared distance sensor and read the voltage of the battery the arduino is connected to.
